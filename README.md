# Hierarchical Clustering - Exploratory Data Analysis
The goal of our research is to observe and evaluate how people in Ho Chi Minh City spend their money. To demonstrate the use of hierarchical clustering, the survey was conducted on a sample of 106 residents. It mainly recorded personal information, educational status, relationship status, income, and spending throughout the month. Following analysis, five major client groups were identified based on the features of the variables. The use of hierarchical clustering analysis allowed a general assessment of consumer opinions on product selection in the shopping aspect. The results of this study provide valuable information on a businessâ€™s strategic planning and operations management. The analysis supports the need for researchers to evaluate the key customer behaviors in business marketing research.
